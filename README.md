# Economic Indicators of World Suicides

**-- Project Status: Completed**

## Project Introduction
This project was done for completion of the "Statistical Learning" class at New College of Florida in Fall 2019 (sophomore year). The motivation of this project is to observe and interpret any differences in suicides per 100k by region and several economic indicators. Observing and understanding the effects of the economic status of a country enables us to get a "big picture" view of the suicide rates around the world and can assist in spreading awareness of mental health and suicides.
