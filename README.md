# World-Suicide-Data-Project
This is a final project for my "Statistical Learning" class that I took at New College of Florida in my sophomore year. Please see the .pdf file all code output and brief descriptions. To see the code, look at the .rmd file. This was a presentation based project, so the pdf is less formal.
